Sometimes, you just want your content to look clear, well-organized, and appealing. But the app, site, or platform where you are supposed to send or upload text doesn’t offer enough formatting options. That’s where invisible text helps out. It enables you to bring visual hierarchy to your written material and makes it better to present to anyone. 

But stop! Do you even know what exactly blank characters are? Or have you used them before anywhere? Well, if you are not familiar with this special type of text, there is nothing to fret about. This article will not only introduce you to empty text but also provide you with smart ways to use it to enhance the presentation of your content. Plus, you will also get familiar with some tools that let you generate such text. So, let’s start without any further delay. 

## Introducing Invisible Text

Invisible text is just like normal text, but the twist is that it doesn’t appear visually. When you add it somewhere, it takes up spaces and gets recognized like standard characters, but you can’t see it. You may be wondering how this actually happens. Well, it’s the Unicode characters that make this possible. These are unique combinations of numbers, symbols, and letters that become invisible like a normal text space. This allows you to separate sections, adjust spacing, or create neat breaks without relying on formatting tools.

## Using Invisible Characters Smartly To Improve Text Presentation

When it comes to using empty characters in content to make it look better, you have different options. Let’s look at the best possible ways to make the most of blank spaces in content.

### Organizing Headings

Headings catch the most attention in a piece of written content. If they are not organized, the text looks unprofessional and less attractive. While normal text editors let you add spaces around headings, sometimes, you work in an app where formatting options are either limited or not available at all. In such a situation, you can add invisible text to give the right amount of spacing before and after the heading. Along with that, blank spaces can also enable you to move headings to the center, left, or right. 

### Aligning Paragraphs

Remember, your paragraphs lose impact when they look messy. If you don’t have any option to align them in the right way, there is nothing to worry about. Just include blank text where needed and achieve your required alignment easily. For example, if your text is left-aligned but you want it to be justified, you fill each line with invisible spaces in the required amount to make them all look even. This small change can increase the overall readability of your text significantly. 

### Separating Sections

Another clever method to use invisible characters in content is to place them between sections to add white space. This is especially useful for platforms where extra line breaks are automatically removed from the text due to character or space limits. With blank characters, you can create as many spaces between two sections as you need without any problem. As you keep adding this text, it keeps getting identified as normal characters and keeps creating space. 

### Highlighting Key Phrases

Highlighting an important phrase can be done by different methods. But sometimes, you don’t want to do so by making the text either bold or changing its color. This is where invisible text comes in handy. With empty text, you can frame a keyword with space above, below, to the right, and to the left of it. When surrounded by enough space, a word automatically becomes more likely to draw attention and enhance the overall presentation of the content.
