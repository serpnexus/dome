      "Näkymättömät merkit ovat Unicode-merkkejä, jotka eivät näytä mitään näkyvää symbolia mutta vievät silti tilaa tekstissä. Niillä on ainutlaatuiset Unicode-arvot ja niitä voidaan käyttää erilaisiin muotoilu- ja luoviin tarkoituksiin.",
    "faq.q2": "Onko näkymättömien merkkien käyttö turvallista?",
    "faq.a2":
      "Kyllä, näkymättömät merkit ovat täysin turvallisia. Ne ovat tavallisia Unicode-merkkejä, joita käytetään monissa sovelluksissa ja verkkosivustoissa. Kuitenkin jotkut alustat saattavat asettaa rajoituksia niiden käytölle käyttäjänimissä tai muissa kentissä.",

    "faq.a4":
      "Se riippuu alustasta. Monet pelit ja sosiaalisen median alustat sallivat näkymättömät merkit käyttäjänimissä, mutta jotkut ovat ottaneet käyttöön rajoituksia estääkseen sekaannuksen tai väärinkäytön. Tarkista aina alustan käytännöt ennen käyttöä.",

      "Voit testata näkymättömiä merkkejä Testialueellamme. Jos teksti näyttää tyhjältä mutta vie silti tilaa, näkymättömät merkkisi toimivat oikein. Voit myös tarkistaa merkkimäärän vahvistaaksesi niiden läsnäolon.",
